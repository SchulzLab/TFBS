NAME

    reader - reading and merging sequence peak data

SYNOPSIS

    reader [options...] [names...]

DESCRIPTION

    Reader computes, given a file of chromosomal regions in (simple)BED or ENCODE
    broadpeak format, for all given peak files in wig format (plain or log values)
    the peak value for each entry in the chromsomal region file.

    It then outputs the result as a matrix.

OTIONS

    -m FILE
	Read FILE as matrix for positive sample set

    -t FILE
	Read FILE as matrix for negative sample set

    -p FILE
        Read FILE as ENCODE broadpeak file for chromosomal regions.

    -b FILE
        Read FILE as BED file. Each line should only provide the obligatory three
        entries "chromosome", "region_start" and "region_end".

    -f FILE
        Read FILE as .wig file with number of reads (no log values) as entries.

    -l FILE
        Read FILE as .wig file with log peak values.

NAMES

    Optionally it is possible to provide names for the column description of the
    resulting matrix. Providing up to the number -l and -f files many names, the
    given names will be matched in the same order as the files are provided.
    
    For all files, for which no names are provided, the corresponding matrix column
    will be named like the given file path.
    
    See section EXAMPLES for examples.

RESULT

    The result of the program in shape of a matrix will be printed in 
    "positive_samples.matrix" and "negative_samples.matrix".
    The first line of the output contains a description for each column.
    Those descriptions are a sequence of non-whitespace characters seperated by 
    whitespace.

EXAMPLES

    We want to compute the peak values for two files for some regions provided
    by a BED file. Since the file names are complex and not nice to read, we also
    want to rename the columns in the resulting matrix.

    reader -b /path/to/bed_file -l /path/to/file_one -l /path/to/file_two nice_name1 nice_name2

    Here the column containing the peaks of file_one will be named nice_name1 and
    the one for file_two nice_name2.



    Now we want to compute the peak for one .wig-file for regions provided by an
    ENCODE broadpeak file. Now we don't need any nice descriptions for the matrix
    columns, the filepath as a name for the corresponding column will be sufficient.
    The peak entries in the .wig-file are no log values.

    reader -p /path/to/broadpeak_file -f /path/to/wig_file



    Finally we want to reuse the just constructed matrix for further work.

    reader -m positive_samples.matrix -t negative_samples.matrix
